# The bs58 command

The following guide shows you how to convert a `keypair.json` into a base58 string.

## Prerequisites

- You must have setup the builderdao CLI.

## Instructions

1. We can use the `builderdao admin bs58 --help` command to see what options we need to pass for the command to execute:

```text
Usage: builderdao admin bs58 [options]

helper

Options:
  --path <path>  keypair json file
  -h, --help     helper

Example call:
$ builderdao admin bs58 --path <path_of_keypair.json>
```

2. Here we see that we need to pass the path of our keypair as an option.
3. Once you have located the path of `keypair.json` holding your secret, go back to your terminal and issue the following command:

```text
builderdao admin bs58 --path test.json
```

4. Which output your encoded secret.
