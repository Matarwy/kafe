# Manage admin Kaf√© list

The following guide shows you how to add and remove admin on Kaf√©.

üö® Please confirm with @Daniel Gamboa before adding or removing admin.

## Prerequisites

- You must have setup the builderdao CLI.
- You must be an admin on Kaf√©.
- You must use your Solana account registered as an admin.

## Instructions

1. Intuitively, we can use two commands to manage admin Kaf√© list, `addAdmin` and `removeAdmin`. To know more, we can use the `builderdao admin addAdmin -h` command to see what options we need to pass:

```text
Usage: builderdao admin addAdmin [options]

Add Admin to Kafe List

Options:
  --adminKp <adminKp>  Admin KeyPair (bs58 encoded) (env: ADMIN_KP)
  --address <address>  address of the receiver
  -h, --help           display help for command

Add an admin Solana pubkey to the Kafe Admin list

Example call to admin:
$ builderdao admin addAdmin --adminKp <bs58Secret> --address <bs58Pubkey>
```

2. Here we see that we need to pass a public address for the account we want to add or remove from the admin Kaf√© list using the option `--address`. Moreover, we need to pass a private key using the `--adminKp` option to authenticate ourselves as an admin.

3. With your private key in your clipboard, go back to your terminal and issue the following command:

```text
builderdao admin addAdmin --adminKp <paste-your-private-key-here>
--address <paste-destination-public-address-here>
```

```text
‚úî signature: <some-signature-hash-if-the-transaction-was-successful>
```
