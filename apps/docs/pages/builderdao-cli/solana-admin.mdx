# The Admin commands

The following guide shows you how and why to use the subcommands under admin command to manage the Kafé program.

## Prerequisites

- You must have setup the builderdao CLI.

## Basic usage

1. This command has many sub-commands that you can see by running `builderdao admin -h`:

```text
Usage: builderdao admin [options] [command]

admin command

Options:
  -h, --help             display help for command

Commands:
  addAdmin [options]     Add Admin to Kafe List
  airdrop [options]      Airdrop token to user
  bs58 [options]         helper
  removeAdmin [options]  Remove Admin to Kafe List
  setAuthor [options]    set the author of a migrated tutorial from LV2
```

2. In order to use the command, you will need the base58 private key of the account you provided to be included as an admin.

- If you’re using Phantom wallet, follow these steps:

  1. Open the Settings by clicking on the gear on the bottom right of the wallet navigation bar.
  2. Scroll to the bottom of Settings and click on the button labeled “Export Private Key”.
  3. Enter your Phantom wallet password.
  4. Copy the private key (it should go without saying, but please keep this safe, make sure no one is looking at your screen, etc).

- If you’re using a `keypair.json` file you'll need to use the `bs58` subcommand:

## help

When using the afford mention subcommands if the transaction fails, it will show an error and give a reason at the top of the error message along with a longer error message that you can safely ignore. If this happens, check your private key. And if you can’t resolve it, please contact @Daniel Gamboa or @Moises Beltran.
