# Tutorial Pre-publish

The prepublish workflow deals with the builderdao-config.service to generate the
builderdao config and lock files, also updating the hash digest of the tutorial folder.

## Prerequisites

- You must have setup the builderdao CLI.
- You must be either in the root of the tutorial folder or in a subfolder of the tutorial folder. `/tutorials/<tutorial-name>`

## Basic usage

```
Usage: builderdao tutorial prepublish [options] [learnPackageName]

Perform pre-publishing tasks

Arguments:
  learnPackageName     Tutorial slug for complete tutorial package

Options:
  --force              Force Rewrite the lock file base on slug (default: false)
  --seed <seed>        Ceramic Seed (env: CERAMIC_SEED)
  --nodeUrl <nodeUrl>  Ceramic Node Url (env: CERAMIC_NODE_URL)
  -h, --help           Display help for command

Example call:
$ builderdao tutorial prepublish near-101
```

## What does it do?

Keeps the builderdao config and lock files up to date base on the tutorial slug. BuilderDAO CLI makes a request to solana & Ceramic to get metadata about the tutorial.

1. Using Solana Client to get coresponding metadata from the tutorial.
2. Using Ceramic Client to get metadata from the tutorial.
3. Update reviewer and author information in the builderdao config file.
4. Update the hash digest of the tutorial folder. This allow us to check if the tutorial files has been modified or not.
