# The Tutorial Commands

The following guide shows you how and why to use the subcommands under tutorial command to manage the Kafé tutorials.

## Prerequisites

- You must have setup the builderdao CLI.
- You must be either in the root of the tutorial folder or in a subfolder of the tutorial folder. `/tutorials/<tutorial-name>`

## Basic usage

1. This command has many sub-commands that you can see by running `builderdao tutorial -h`:

```text
Usage: builderdao tutorial [options] [command]

Initialize & publish Kafé tutorials

Options:
  -h, --help                               display help for command

Commands:
  get <learnPackageName>                   Display metadata for a single tutorial
  init [options]                           Initialize a tutorial package from a proposal
  list                                     List all tutorials and metadata
  prepublish [options] [learnPackageName]  Perform pre-publishing tasks
  publish [options] [learnPackageName]     Publish tutorial to Arweave & Ceramic
```

2. In order to use some of the commands, you must be in the root of the tutorial folder: `init`, `prepublish` and `publish` commands are available in the root of the tutorial folder. You can also run the `prepublish` or `publish` commands in a subfolder of the tutorial folder. Some commands can run anywhere, such as `get` or `list`.
