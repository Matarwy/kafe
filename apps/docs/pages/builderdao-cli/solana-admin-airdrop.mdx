# The airdop command

The following guide shows you how to send $KAFE and $BDR tokens to alpha testnet users.

ðŸš¨ Please confirm with Daniel Gamboa before sending tokens to non-Figment addresses.

## Prerequisites

- You must have setup the builderdao CLI.
- You must be an admin on KafÃ©.
- You must use your Solana account registered as an admin.

## Instructions

1. In order to send tokens, we will need the `airdrop` subcommand.
2. Intuitively, we can use the airdrop command to send tokens. Before we do that, we can use the `builderdao admin airdrop -h` command to see what options we need to pass for the command to execute:

```text
builderdao admin airdrop --help
Usage: builderdao admin airdrop [options]

Airdrop token to user

Options:
--adminKp <adminKp> Admin KeyPair (bs58 encoded) (env: ADMIN_KP)
--address <address> address of the receiver
--onlyKafe Airdrop only Kafe Token
--onlyBDR Airdrop only BDR Token
-h, --help display help for command

Aidrop info:

- 1 Kafe Token
- 100 BDR Token (frozen)

Example call to airdrop both Kafe and BDR token:
$ builderdao admin airdrop --adminKp <bs58Secret> --address <bs58Pubkey>

Example call to airdrop only BDR token:
$ builderdao admin airdrop --adminKp <bs58Secret> --address <bs58Pubkey> --onlyBDR

Example call to airdrop only Kafe token:
$ builderdao admin airdrop --adminKp <bs58Secret> --address <bs58Pubkey> --onlyKafe
```

3. Here we see that we need to pass a public address for the account we want to send tokens using the option `--address`. Moreover, we need to pass a private key using the `--adminKp` option to authenticate ourselves as an admin. We also see that we have the option to send 1 $KAFE and 100 $BDR at the same time, or to choose one to send by itself.

4. With your private key in your clipboard, go back to your terminal and issue the following command:

```text
builderdao admin airdrop --adminKp <paste-your-private-key-here>
--address <paste-destination-public-address-here>
```

```text
âœ” signature: <some-signature-hash-if-the-transaction-was-successful>
```
