# GitHub Workflows - labeler

We are using [actions/labeler@v4](https://github.com/actions/labeler) from GitHub to identify and apply labels for the pull request. It is a simple tool that allows us to label a pull request based on the files it contains. For example, pull requests containing files in the `apps/docs` directory will be labelled as `docs`.

Defination of the labels is defineted in the [labeler.yml](https://github.com/TheBuilderDAO/kafe/blob/dev/.github/workflows/labeler.yaml) file.

```yaml
dao-program:
  - dao-programs/*
  - dao-programs/**/*

frontend:
  - any: ['apps/web/**/*']

tutorial:
  - any: ['tutorials/**/*']

docs:
  - any: ['apps/docs/**/*']
```
