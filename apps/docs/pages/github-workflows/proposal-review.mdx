# GitHub Workflows - proposal-review

The proposal-review Action is responsible for checking the pull requests created from the content proposals on Kaf√©. It checks the corresponding proposal to determine which reviewers need to be assigned to the pull request.

## Triggers

```yaml
pull_request_review:
pull_request_target:
  types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]
  branches:
    - 'dev'
    - 'main'
```

## Jobs

### get_proposal_slug

In this job, we get the slug of the proposal from the pull request branch name.
The branch name is in the format of `tutorials/<slug>`. We match the slug using a Regular Expression (regex).

```js
const headBranch = context.payload.pull_request.head.ref;
const regex = /tutorials\/([A-z0-9]+(?:[_-][A-z0-9]+)*)/;
const slug = headBranch.match(regex);
return (slug && slug[1]) || '';
```

#### Output

The expected output of this job is the slug of the proposal, in lower-kebab-case.

### fetch_proposal

In this job, we fetch the proposal from the Builder DAO CLI tool. And we are assigning as a variable to the context.

```bash
builderdao proposal get -s $SLUG
REVIEWER1=$(builderdao proposal get -s $SLUG -k reviewer1 --skip-ceramic)
REVIEWER2=$(builderdao proposal get -s $SLUG -k reviewer2 --skip-ceramic)
PROPOSAL_ID=$(builderdao proposal get -s $SLUG -k id --skip-ceramic)
PROPOSAL_STATE=$(builderdao proposal get -s $SLUG -k state --skip-ceramic)
REVIEWER1_GITHUBNAME=$(builderdao reviewer get -p $REVIEWER1 -k githubName)
REVIEWER2_GITHUBNAME=$(builderdao reviewer get -p $REVIEWER2 -k githubName)
```

### comment

In this job, we comment on the PR with the metadata of the proposal.

### check_review_status

In this job we are utilizing the GitHub API to check the status of the review from designated reviewers assigned by BuilderDAO.
the [check-required-reviewer](../github-actions/check-required-reviewer) action is responsible for checking the required reviewers.

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- uses: ./.github/actions/check-required-reviewer
  id: reviewer1_review
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    AUTHOR: ${{needs.fetch_proposal.outputs.reviewer1_githubName}}
```

after we collect the status of the reviewers we are determining the status of the proposal.
If both reviewers are approved, we are setting the `state` of the proposal

```
  - id: check_all_reviewers_approved
    env:
      ALL_REQUIRED_REVIEWERS_APPROVED: ${{steps.reviewer1_review.outputs.state == 'APPROVED' && steps.reviewer2_review.outputs.state  == 'APPROVED'}}
    run: |
      echo $ALL_REQUIRED_REVIEWERS_APPROVED
      STATUS=$([ "$ALL_REQUIRED_REVIEWERS_APPROVED" == true ] && echo "readyToPublish" || echo "writing")
      echo $STATUS
      echo "::set-output name=state::$STATUS"
```

#### set_state

In this job, we are setting the state of the proposal in Solana Program via BuilderDAO CLI tool.

```
  - id: set_state
    env:
      PROPOSAL_ID: ${{ needs.fetch_proposal.outputs.proposalId }}
      TESTNET_ADMIN_KP: ${{ secrets.TESTNET_ADMIN_KP }}
      NEW_STATE: ${{ steps.check_all_reviewers_approved.outputs.state }}
    run: |
        builderdao proposal setstate $PROPOSAL_ID --state=$NEW_STATE --adminKp $TESTNET_ADMIN_KP
```

#### ready_label

If the proposal state is `ready_to_publish`, in this step we are adding the `tutorial` and `ready_to_publish` labels to the PR to give a visual cue for the contributors and anybody looking at the list of pull requests.

#### pending_label

As the outcome of the review process, the state of the proposal might change to `writing` or `readyToPublish`. In this job, we are updating the Algolia index of the proposal. You can find an explanation of this step in the Algolia documentation.

### update_algolia_index

As the outcome of the review process, the state of the proposal might change to `writing` or `readyToPublish`. In this job, we are updating the Algolia index of the proposal. You can find an explanation of this step in the Algolia documentation.
{/* TODO: add documentation link. */}

```
  - id: update_algolia_index
      env:
        OBJECT_ID: ${{ steps.fetch.outputs.proposalId }}
        PROPOSAL_STATE: ${{ steps.fetch.outputs.proposalState }}
        ALGOLIA_APP_ID: ${{ secrets.ALGOLIA_APP_ID }}
        ALGOLIA_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.ALGOLIA_WRITE_API_KEY }}
        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME: ${{ secrets.ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME }}
      run: |
        builderdao algolia updateIndex $OBJECT_ID --data='{"state": "$PROPOSAL_STATE"}' --appId $ALGOLIA_APP_ID --accessKey $ALGOLIA_ACCESS_KEY --indexName $ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME
```

### request_reviews

This is the job where we request reviews of the pull request from the designated reviewers.

```
    if: contains(needs.check_review_status.outputs.state, 'writing')
```

This leverages the github-script action to use the GitHub API to request reviewers.

```
  uses: actions/github-script@v6
  with:
    script: |
      github.rest.pulls.requestReviewers({
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
        pull_number: ${{github.event.pull_request.number}},
        reviewers: [
          "${{needs.fetch_proposal.outputs.reviewer1_githubName}}",
          "${{needs.fetch_proposal.outputs.reviewer2_githubName}}"
        ]
      });
```
