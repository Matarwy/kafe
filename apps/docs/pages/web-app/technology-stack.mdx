# Technology stack

For building Kaf√© we've used many different technologies:

- _Typescript_ - TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. We use it because we love static typing (https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- _NextJS_ - Modern framework for building front-end apps with server side rendering. We use it because it makes it easy to create static web pages (https://nextjs.org/)
- _React_ - Build composable UI (https://reactjs.org/)
- _TailwindCSS_ - Style your web app. We use it because our design requires a lot of customization. With TailwindCSS we can be really flexible with our UI and everything can be controlled from one tailwind.config.js file (https://tailwindcss.com/)
- _Vercel_ - To deploy your app. We use it because it works great with NextJS, especially SSR, SSG and ISR (https://vercel.com/)
- _Turborepo_ - Monorepos made easy. We use it because it is really powerful and it is built by Vercel (https://turborepo.org/)
- _Sentry_ - Logging errors. We use it because it has great integration with NextJS (https://sentry.io/)
- _swr_ - Used to fetch and cache data on front-end (https://swr.vercel.app/)
- _Solana Wallet Adapter_ - A set of React components and utility functions to make connection to Solana blockchain possible (https://solana-labs.github.io/wallet-adapter/)
- _arweave_ and _ardb_ - Clients responsible for connecting to Arweave blockchain (https://www.npmjs.com/package/arweave and https://www.npmjs.com/package/ardb)
- _algoliasearch_ - A comprehensive set of React components and utility function allowing to manage indexes and render search pages (https://www.npmjs.com/package/algoliasearch)
- _@ceramicnetwork/http-client_ - Official client to connect to Ceramic network nodes (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ceramicnetwork/http-client)
- _@solana/web3.js_ - Solana Javascript API built on the Solana JSON RPC API (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/web3.js)
