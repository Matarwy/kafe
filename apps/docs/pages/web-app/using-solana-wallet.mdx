# Using Solana wallet

The Kafé program is built on the Solana blockchain. In order to interact with Solana and therefore with Kafé, every user needs to have a wallet, and SOL tokens. There are many different wallets you can use:

- Phantom
- Solflare
- Sollet
- Glow Wallet
- Torus Wallet
- Ledger Wallet
  To connect to those wallets, Kafé uses an NPM package called Solana Wallet Adapter. It comes with a set of React components and utility functions to make the connection process seamless.

## How to connect your wallet?

- 1.  Make sure that you use one of above links to install Solana wallet of your choice
- 2. With Kafé web app click on Connect wallet button

- 3. A modal window should open where you can see all of your installed wallets

- 4. Clicking on the wallet of your choice should redirect you to that wallet where you most likely will need to log in.

That's it! Now to confirm that you are logged in, instead of Connect wallet button you should see a button with the icon of your wallet and your wallet address
