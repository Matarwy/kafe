# Contributing

The Builder DAO community is dedicated to advancing the next phase of the Web and building a better internet, together. Core to everything we do are the ideas of (1) _constantly enhancing our ability to build through learning_ and (2) _cultivating a supportive community of builders that encourage each other_.

We're super happy you're interested in contributing to the core infrastructure that enables us to collaborate and learn from each other. If you have any questions on the guidelines below, please reach out on [Discord](http://discord.gg/r4vNRUTXY9).

## Code of Conduct

It's early days. We haven't formally adopted a code of conduct yet, but our values are aligned with the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). Please check it out.

## Guidelines

### Branch Organization

- The `main` branch is where the production application lives.
- We keep staging work on the `dev` branch.
- Other branches are for development work, fixing bugs, or addressing issues.

### Proposing a Change

- If you want to propose a change, please open an issue:
  - The issue should include a concise, well-written title.
  - Please describe the proposed change as concisely and comprehensively as possible.
- If you want to take on an issue:
  - Please comment on the issue so the community knows someone is working on it.
  - If a contributor has been silent on their progress for more than two weeks, feel free to reach out to them and take on the issue if you don't hear back. Maybe they got busy before finishing and forgot to comment back. That's OK.
  - You should also check [open pull requests](https://github.com/TheBuilderDAO/kafe/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+) (PRs) for duplicates.
- To submit a change or fix, use a PR from a fork:
  - Fork the repo, clone it to your local environment and create an issue-specific branch from the `dev` branch.
  - Run `yarn` to install the dependencies.
  - Please add tests if you have added new core functionality or fixed an issue that wasn't tested before.
  - Please remember to format your code. We use [prettier](https://prettier.io/).
  - In your PR, please provide a concise and comprehensive description of the work so reviewers can approve or request changes expeditiously.
